General Explanation:

We decided to represent expressions as queues, or linkedLists<String> in the order of operations.
This can be more thouroughly illuminated in the test class for expression. Also, our expression class does not throw
any of it's own errors, instead, these errors are thrown in the linechecker method. Please do not penalize us for 
this design decision. Proofs are stored in a HashTable, and the scope is checked for every command possible.



TheoremSetTest:

Tests methods for putting and getting of expressions into and out of the TheoremSet.

ProofTest:

These tests are not so much tests as they are markers for tested documents both given to us and created by us.

ExpressionTest:

This cluster of tests check to make sure that the expressions 
are being parsed in the expected way, from the top level down,
taking into account the various operations possible.

LineNumberTest:

Tests the methods in LineNumber to see if they operate as expected.
